# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer
The "pathfinding-visualizer" project is a Python-based application that utilizes the Pygame library and custom tkinter components. Its primary purpose is to provide a visual representation of three different pathfinding algorithms: A-star, Dijkstra, and Depth-First Search (DFS).

Users of this project can interact with it to observe how these algorithms work in finding the optimal paths within a specified grid or maze. Here are some key features and components of the project:

1. **Python-Based:** The project is written in Python, making it accessible to a wide range of users who are familiar with the language.

2. **Pygame:** Pygame is used for rendering graphics and creating an interactive environment for visualizing the pathfinding algorithms. It offers a simple way to handle graphics and user input.

3. **tkinter Components:** Custom tkinter components are integrated into the project's user interface to provide user controls and options for selecting algorithms, adjusting settings, and interacting with the visualization.

4. **Pathfinding Algorithms:**
   - **A-star:** A-star is a popular pathfinding algorithm known for finding the shortest path efficiently while considering both the cost to reach a node and a heuristic estimate of the remaining cost.
   - **Dijkstra:** Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph, considering only the cost to reach a node without any heuristic estimation.
   - **DFS (Depth-First Search):** DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

5. **Grid or Maze Environment:** Users can create custom grids or mazes within the application, providing a practical scenario for testing and visualizing the pathfinding algorithms.

Overall, the "pathfinding-visualizer" project is a valuable tool for educational purposes and practical applications, allowing users to gain insights into the behavior and efficiency of different pathfinding algorithms by visually observing their operation within a grid or maze environment.
